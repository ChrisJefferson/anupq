                 PqExample Index (Table of Contents)
                 -----------------------------------
This table of possible examples is displayed when calling `PqExample'
with no arguments, or with the argument: "index" (meant in the  sense
of ``list''), or with a non-existent example name.

Examples that have a name ending in `-ni' are  non-interactive  only.
Examples that have a  name  ending  in  `-i'  are  interactive  only.
Examples with names ending in `.g' also have  only  one  form.  Other
examples have both a non-interactive and an  interactive  form;  call
`PqExample' with 2nd argument `PqStart' to get the  interactive  form
of the example. The substring `SP' in an  example  name  indicates  a
Standard  Presentation  example  and  `Rel'  indicates  it  uses  the
`Relators' option.

The following ANUPQ examples are available:

   "Pq"      "Pq-ni"      "PqEpimorphism"     "IsIsomorphicPGroup-ni"
   "PqDescendants-1"      "PqDescendants-2"   "PqDescendants-3"
   "B5-4.g"

Notes
-----
1. The example (first) argument of  `PqExample'  is  a  string;  each
   example above is in double quotes to remind you to include them.
2. Some examples accept options. To find  out  whether  a  particular
   example accepts options, display it first (by including  `Display'
   as  last  argument)  which  will  also  indicate  how  `PqExample'
   interprets the options, e.g. `PqExample("11gp-SP-a-i", Display);'.
3. Try `SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, <n>);' for  some  <n>  in  [2  ..  4]
   before calling PqExample, to see what's going on behind the scenes.
