<Chapter Label="Installing the ANUPQ Package">
<Heading>Installing the ANUPQ Package</Heading>

The ANU  <C>pq</C> program is  written in C  and the package can  be installed
under UNIX  and in environments  similar to UNIX. In particular
it is known to work on Linux and Mac OS X, and also on Windows
equipped with cygwin.
<P/>
The current version of the  &ANUPQ;  package  requires  &GAP;&nbsp;4.4,  and
version 1.2 of the &AutPGrp; package. However, we recommend using
at least &GAP;&nbsp;4.6 and &AutPGrp;&nbsp;1.5.
<P/>
To install the &ANUPQ; package, move the file <C>anupq-<A>XXX</A>.tar.gz</C> for some
version number <A>XXX</A> into the  <C>pkg</C>  directory  in  which  you  plan  to
install &ANUPQ;. Usually, this  will  be  the  directory  <C>pkg</C>  in  the
hierarchy of your version of &GAP;; it is  however  also  possible  to
keep an additional <C>pkg</C> directory in your private directories. The  only
essential difference  with  installing  &ANUPQ;  in  a  <C>pkg</C>  directory
different to the &GAP; home directory is that one  must  start  &GAP;
with the <C>-l</C> switch (see Section&nbsp;<Ref ???="ref:Command  Line  Options"/>),  e.g.&nbsp;if
your private <C>pkg</C> directory is a subdirectory of <C>mygap</C>  in  your  home
directory you might type:
<P/>
<!-- %begintt -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;<C>gap -l <Ref ???=";<A>myhomedir</A>/mygap"/></C>
<!-- %endtt -->
<P/>
where <A>myhomedir</A> is the  path  to  your  home  directory,  which 
may be replaced  by  a  tilde.  The  empty  path  before  the
semicolon is  filled  in  by  the  default  path  of  the  &GAP;  home
directory.
<P/>
Then, in your chosen <C>pkg</C> directory, unpack <C>anupq-<A>XXX</A>.tar.gz</C> by
<P/>
%<Log><![CDATA[
\){\kernttindent}tar xf anupq-<XXX>.tar.gz
%]]></Log>
<P/>
Change to the newly created <C>anupq</C>  directory.  Now  you  need  to  call
<C>configure</C>. If you installed &ANUPQ; into the  main  <C>pkg</C>  directory,
call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./configure
]]></Log>
<P/>
If you installed ANUPQ in another directory than the usual 'pkg'
subdirectory, instead call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./configure --with-gaproot=<path>
]]></Log>
<P/>
where <A>path</A> is the path to the &GAP; home directory. (You can also call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./configure --help
]]></Log>
<P/>
for further options.)
<P/>
What this does is look for a file <C>sysinfo.gap</C> in the root directory  of
&GAP; in order to determine an architecture name for the subdirectory of
<C>bin</C> in which to put the compiled <C>pq</C> binary. This only makes sense  if
&GAP; was compiled for the same architecture that <C>pq</C> will be.  If  you
have a shared file system mounted across  different  architectures,  then
you should run <C>configure</C> and <C>make</C> for &ANUPQ; for each  architecture
immediately after compiling &GAP; on the same architecture.
<P/>
If you had to install the package in your own directory but wish  to  use
the system &GAP; then you will need to find out what <A>path</A> is. To  do
this, start up &GAP; and find  out  what  &GAP;'s  root  path  is  from
finding the value of the  variable  <C>GAPInfo.RootPaths</C>, e.g.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
gap> GAPInfo.RootPaths;
[ "/usr/local/lib/gap4r4/" ]
]]></Log>
<P/>
would tell you to use <C>/usr/local/lib/gap4r4</C> for <A>path</A>.
<P/>
The <C>configure</C> command will fetch the architecture type for which &GAP;
has been compiled  last and  create  a  <C>Makefile</C>. You  can  now
simply call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
make
]]></Log>
<P/>
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.
<P/>
<Index Key="ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC!environment variable"><C>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC!environment variable</C></Index>
The path of &GAP; (see <E>Note</E> below) used by the <C>pq</C> binary (the  value
<C>GAP</C> is set to in the <C>make</C> command) may be over-ridden by setting  the
environment variable <C>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</C>. These values are only of  interest
when the <C>pq</C> program is run  as  a  standalone;  however,  the  <C>testPq</C>
script assumes you have set one of these correctly (see  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Testing
your ANUPQ installation"/>). When the <C>pq</C> program is started  from  &GAP;
communication occurs via an iostream, so that the <C>pq</C>  binary  does  not
actually need to know a valid path for &GAP; is this case.
<P/>
<E>Note.</E> By <Q>path of &GAP;</Q> we mean the path of  the  command  used  to
invoke &GAP; (which  should  be  a  script,  e.g.  the  <C>gap.sh</C>  script
generated in the <C>bin</C> directory for the version of  &GAP;  when  &GAP;
was compiled). The usual strategy is to copy the  <C>gap.sh</C>  script  to  a
standard location, e.g. <C>/usr/local/bin/gap</C>. It is a mistake to copy the
&GAP;  executable  <C>gap</C>   (in   a   directory   with   name   of   form
<C>bin/<A>compile-platform</A></C>)  to  the  standard   location,   since   direct
invocation of the executable results in  &GAP;  starting  without  being
able to find its own library (a fatal error).

Now it is time to test the  installation.  After  doing  <C>configure</C>  and
<C>make</C> you will have a <C>testPq</C> script. The script assumes that,  if  the
environment variable <C>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</C> is set, it is a  correct  path  for
&GAP;, or otherwise that the <C>make</C> call that compiled the  <C>pq</C> program
set <C>GAP</C> to a correct path  for  &GAP;  (see  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Running  the  pq
program as a standalone"/> for more details). To run the tests, just type:
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./testPq
]]></Log>
<P/>
Some of the tests the script runs take a while. Please  be  patient.  The
script checks that you not only have a correct &GAP; (at  least  version
4.4) installation that includes the  &AutPGrp;  package,  but  that  the
&ANUPQ; package and its <C>pq</C> binary interact correctly. You  should  see
something like the following output:
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[

<Index Key="ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC!environment variable"><C>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC!environment variable</C></Index>
When the <C>pq</C> program is run as a standalone it sometimes  needs  to call
&GAP; to compute stabilisers of subgroups; in doing so, it first  checks
the value of the environment variable <C>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</C>, and uses that, if
set, or otherwise the value of <C>GAP</C> it was compiled with,  as  the  path
for  &GAP;.  If  you  ran  <C>testPq</C>  (see  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Testing  your  ANUPQ
installation"/>) and you got both &GAP; is <C>OK</C> and the link  between  the
<C>pq</C> binary and &GAP; is <C>OK</C>, you should be fine.  Otherwise  heed  the
recommendations of the error messages you get and run the <C>testPq</C>  until
all tests are passed.
<P/>
It is especially important that the &GAP;, whose path you  gave,  should
know where to find the &ANUPQ; and &AutPGrp; packages. To  ensure  this
the path should be to a shell script that invokes &GAP;. If  you  needed
to install the needed packages in your own directory (because,  say,  you
are not a system administrator) then you should  create  your  own  shell
script that runs &GAP; with a correct setting of the <C>-l</C> option and set
the path used by the <C>pq</C> binary to the path of that  script.  To  create
the script that runs &GAP; it is easiest to copy the system one and edit
it, e.g. start by executing the following UNIX commands (skip the  second
step if you already have a <C>bin</C>  directory;  <C>you@unix></C>  is  your  UNIX
prompt):
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
you@unix> cd
you@unix> mkdir bin
you@unix> cd bin
you@unix> which gap
/usr/local/bin/gap
you@unix> cp /usr/local/bin/gap mygap
you@unix> chmod +x mygap
]]></Log>
<P/>
At the second-last step use the path of &GAP; returned by  <C>which  gap</C>.
Now hopefully you will have a copy of the script  that  runs  the  system
&GAP; in <C>mygap</C>. Now use your favourite editor to edit the <C>-l</C> part of
the last line of <C>mygap</C> which should initially look something like:
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
exec $GAP_DIR/bin/$GAP_PRG -m $GAP_MEM -o 970m -l $GAP_DIR $*
]]></Log>
<P/>
so that it becomes (the tilde  is  a  UNIX  abbreviation  for  your  home
directory):
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
exec $GAP_DIR/bin/$GAP_PRG -m $GAP_MEM -o 970m -l "$GAP_DIR;~/gapstuff" $*
]]></Log>
<P/>
assuming that your personal &GAP; <C>pkg</C> directory is a  subdirectory  of
<C>gapstuff</C> in your home directory. Finally, to let the <C>pq</C> program  know
where &GAP; is and also know where your <C>pkg</C> directory is that contains
&ANUPQ;, set the environment variable <C>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</C> to  the  complete
(i.e. absolute) path of  your  <C>mygap</C>  script  (do  not  use  the  tilde
abbreviation).

The input to and the output from the <C>pq</C> program  is,  by  default,  not
displayed. However the user may choose to  see  some,  or  all,  of  this
input/output.   This   is   done   via   the   <C>Info</C>   mechanism    (see
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref ???="ref:Info Functions"/> in the &GAP; Reference  Manual).  For  this
purpose, there is the <A>InfoClass</A>  <C>InfoANUPQ</C>.  If  the  <C>InfoLevel</C>  of
<C>InfoANUPQ</C> is high enough each line of <C>pq</C> input/output is directed  to
a call to <C>Info</C> and will be displayed for the user to see.  By  default,
the <C>InfoLevel</C> of <C>InfoANUPQ</C> is 1, and it is recommended that you leave
it at this level, or higher. Messages that  the  user  should  presumably
want to see and output from the <C>pq</C> program influenced by the  value  of
the option <C>OutputLevel</C> (see the options listed in Section&nbsp;<Ref Func="Pq"/>),  other
than timing and memory usage are directed to <C>Info</C> at <C>InfoANUPQ</C>  level
1.
<P/>
To turn off <E>all</E> <C>InfoANUPQ</C> messaging, set the <C>InfoANUPQ</C> level to 0.
<P/>
There are five other user-intended <C>InfoANUPQ</C> levels: 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[

<P/>
enables the display of most timing and memory usage data  from  the  <C>pq</C>
program, and also the number of identity instances when the  <C>Identities</C>
option is used. (Some timing and memory  usage  data,  particularly  when
profuse in quantity, is <C>Info</C>-ed at <C>InfoANUPQ</C> level 3  instead.)  Note
that the the &GAP; functions <C>time</C> and <C>Runtime</C> (see&nbsp;<Ref ???="ref:Runtime"/>  in
the &GAP; Reference Manual) count the time spent by &GAP; and <E>not</E> the
time spent by the (external) <C>pq</C> program.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, 3);
]]></Example>
<P/>
enables the display of output of the nature of the first two  <C>InfoANUPQ</C>
that was not directly invoked by the  user  (e.g.&nbsp;some  commands  require
&GAP; to discover something about the current state known  to  the  <C>pq</C>
program). The identity instances processed under the <C>Identities</C>  option
are also displayed at  this  level.  In  some  cases,  the  <C>pq</C>  program
produces a  lot  of  output  despite  the  fact  that  the  <C>OutputLevel</C>
(see&nbsp;<Ref ????="option OutputLevel"/>) is unset or is set to 0; such output  is  also
<C>Info</C>-ed at <C>InfoANUPQ</C> level 3.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[

<P/>
enables the display of all the commands  directed  to  the  <C>pq</C>  program,
behind a <Q><C>ToPQ> </Q></C> prompt (so that you can  distinguish  it  from  the
output from the <C>pq</C> program). See Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Hints and Warnings  regarding
the use of  Options"/>  for  an  example  of  how  this  can  be  a  useful
troubleshooting tool.
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
