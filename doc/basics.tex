\Chapter{Mathematical Background and Terminology}

The {\GAP}~4 package {\ANUPQ} provides an  interface  to  the  ANU  PQ  C
progam `pq' written by Eamonn O'Brien, making the functionality of the  C
program available to {\GAP}. Henceforth, we shall refer to  the  {\ANUPQ}
package (resp. the `pq' binary), when  discussing  the  {\GAP}  component
(resp. the C code component) of ANU PQ. The ANU `pq' standalone  provides
access to implementations of the following algorithms:

\beginlist

\item{1.}
A $p$-quotient  algorithm  to  compute  pc-presentations  for  $p$-factor
groups of finitely presented groups. The algorithm  implemented  here  is
based on that described by Newman  and  O'Brien  \cite{NO96},  Havas  and
Newman~\cite{HN80}, and papers referred to there. Another description  of
the algorithm is given by Vaughan-Lee (see~\cite{Vau90a}, \cite{Vau90b}).
A FORTRAN implementation of this algorithm was programmed by  Alford  and
Havas. The basic data structures of that implementation are retained.

\item{2.} 
A $p$-group generation algorithm to generate pc-presentations  of  groups
of prime power order. The algorithm implemented  here  is  based  on  the
algorithms described by Newman~\cite{New77} and  O'Brien~\cite{OBr90}.  A
FORTRAN implementation of this algorithm was developed earlier by  Newman
and O'Brien.

\item{3.}
A  standard  presentation  algorithm  used   to   compute   a   canonical
pc-presentation  of  a  $p$-group.  The  algorithm  implemented  here  is
described in~\cite{OBr94}.

\item{4.} 
An algorithm which can be used to compute the  automorphism  group  of  a
$p$-group. The algorithm implemented here is  described  in~\cite{OBr94}.
This part of  the  standalone  program  is  not  accessible  through  the
{\ANUPQ} package. Instead, users are advised  to  consider  the  {\GAP}~4
package {\AutPGrp}, which implements a better algorithm in {\GAP} for the
computation of automorphism groups of $p$-groups.

\endlist

Further   background   may   be   found   in~\cite{OBr95},   \cite{Vau84},
\cite{NNN98}, and~\cite{Sims94}.

For details regarding the standalone version see the file `guide.dvi'.

\index{capable}
We say a $p$-quotient descendant is *capable* if that  descendant  occurs
as the  factor  group  of  a  $p$-group  modulo  the  last  term  of  its
$p$-central series.
