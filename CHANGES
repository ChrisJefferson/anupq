In this file we record the changes since the first GAP 4 release of
the ANUPQ package.

Version 1.4:
   o src/malloc.h: 
       debugging file removed
   o src/print_multiweight.c: 
       removed unnecessary line: #include <malloc.h>
   o README, VERSION, PkgInfo.g, doc/{install,intro,infra}.tex
       1.3 changed to 1.4
   o testPq.in:
       Added more bullet-proofing, and more intelligent messages when 
       things go wrong
Version 1.3:
   o init.g:
       - now use `StringFile' rather than iostreams to read `VERSION' 
         (more efficient)
       - now looks for version 1.1 of AutPGrp
   o testPq.in:
       - Added -A option to GAP command.
       - now looks for version 1.1 of AutPGrp 
   o lib/{anusp.gi,anupga.gi}:
       On suggestion of Alexander Hulpke added `IsSyllableWordsFamily'
       as first argument to `FreeGroup' commands when the group is
       subsequently converted to a pc group (more efficient)
   o tst/anupqeg.tst:
       Remade.
   o doc/basics.tex:
       Fixed typo.
   o README, VERSION, PkgInfo.g, doc/{install,intro,infra}.tex
       1.2 changed to 1.3
Version 1.2:
   A number of bugs to do with the input of generators/relations were
   identified by Robert Morse (thanks Robert):
   o PQ_GROUP_FROM_PCP (lib/anupq.gi line 531):
       `GroupHomomorphismByImages' replaced by `GroupHomomorphismByImagesNC'
       Reason: The check was unnecessary and slowed things down enormously.
   o PQ_PC_PRESENTATION (lib/anupq.gi):
       - datarec.gens, datarec.rels: previously `String' was applied to
         the generators/relators provided and then stored in datarec.gens,
         datarec.rels; this can be enormously costly. Now, no processing
         is done when GAP already has them in another form (for pc groups,
         however, the relators are calculated as before and stored as
         strings, in datec.rels). The conversion to String is now only done
         at the point of transmission to the pq program, and done in `ToPQk'.
       - datarec.gens: an Error is now emitted if the number of defining gen'rs
         is larger than 511 (the limit imposed by the pq program, see MAXGENS
         in `include/runtime.h').
   o ToPQk (lib/anupqios.gi):
       When `ToPQk' is called with `cmd' equal to "gens" or "rels", cmd is
       treated as the field of `datarec' so that the transmission of generators
       and relators to the pq program can be treated specially, to improve 
       efficiency. The data is still split into ``nice'' lines of length < 69
       characters, but care is taken to avoid infinite loops when there are
       no nice places to break the lines.
   Also updated for changes made in GAP 4.3fix4. 
   o PqSupplementInnerAutomorphisms (lib/anupga.gi):
       `SetPcgs' changed to `SetGeneralizedPcgs'.
   o PQ_AUT_INPUT (lib/anupqi.gi):
       `Pcgs' changed to `GeneralizedPcgs'.
   Now requires at least GAP 4.3fix4 and updated AutPGrp package 
   (in .../autpgrp/gap/autos.gi `ConvertHybridAutGroup' uses 
   `SetGeneralizedPcgs' in lieu of `SetPcgs'.)
   o lib/anupq4r2cpt.g[id]: 
       deprecated.
   o init.g:
       commented out backward compatibility with GAP 4.2, since version 1.2
       requires GAP 4.3fix4 anyway.
   Updated:
   o testPq.in:
       checks for new requirements mentioned above.
   o make_zoo
   o README
   o doc/{intro.tex,install.tex}
   Added:
   o PkgInfo.g

Version 1.1:
  First GAP 4 release (GAP 4.2 compatible). Updates the GAP 3 release
  (Version 1.0). Basically, Version 1.0 and 1.1 are incompatible, being
  for different versions of GAP, but as much as was feasible of the original 
  was retained. Principal differences are: 
   o the key commands all take one argument, with any of the previous 
     arguments being input as options; the GAP 3 way of inputting arguments is
     still supported for Pq, PqEpimorphism, PqDescendants etc.;
   o iostreams are used instead of files to communicate with the pq program;
   o the source code has been modified to support a -G option that allows the
     pq program to communicate with GAP via the iostream, rather than start
     up a new GAP, when it needs GAP to compute stabilisers;
   o the source code has also been modified to remove a few bugs;
   o the functionality has been significantly increased.
