The directories: TEST/, isom/, gap/ are obsolete.
TEST/, isom/ and (standalone) examples/ are now in 
directory standalone/.
The directories gap/lib/, gap/tst/, gap/examples/
are now lib/, tst/, examples/, respectively.
All other subdirectories of gap/ are no longer 
needed. 

This note was added since it's not possible to do
simple directory moves under CVS. Old directories
are still kept.
