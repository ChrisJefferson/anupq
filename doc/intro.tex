\Chapter{Introduction}

\index{ANUPQ}
The {\GAP}~4 package {\ANUPQ} provides an  interface  to  the  ANU  PQ  C
progam `pq' written by Eamonn O'Brien, making the functionality of the  C
program available to {\GAP}. Henceforth, we shall refer to  the  {\ANUPQ}
interface (resp. the `pq' binary), when discussing the  {\GAP}  component
(resp. the C code component) of the {\ANUPQ} package.  The  `pq'  program
consists of implementations of the following algorithms:

\beginlist%ordered

\item{1.}
A *$p$-quotient algorithm* to  compute  pc-presentations  for  $p$-factor
groups of finitely presented groups.

%The algorithm implemented here is based on that described by  Newman  and
%O'Brien \cite{NO96}, Havas and Newman~\cite{HN80}, and papers referred to
%there. Another description of  the  algorithm  is  given  by  Vaughan-Lee
%(see~\cite{Vau90a}, \cite{Vau90b}).  A  FORTRAN  implementation  of  this
%algorithm was programmed by Alford and Havas. The basic  data  structures
%of that implementation are retained.

\item{2.} 
A *$p$-group generation algorithm* to generate pc-presentations of groups
of prime power order.

%The algorithm implemented here is based on the  algorithms  described  by
%Newman~\cite{New77} and O'Brien~\cite{OBr90}. A FORTRAN implementation of
%this algorithm was developed earlier by Newman and O'Brien.

\item{3.}
A  *standard  presentation  algorithm*  used  to  compute   a   canonical
pc-presentation of a $p$-group.

%The algorithm implemented here is described in~\cite{OBr94}.

\item{4.} 
An algorithm which can be used to compute the *automorphism group*  of  a
$p$-group.

\item{}
This part of the `pq' program is  not  accessible  through  the  {\ANUPQ}
package. Instead, users are advised  to  consider  the  {\GAP}~4  package
{\AutPGrp}, which  implements  a  better  algorithm  in  {\GAP}  for  the
computation of automorphism groups of $p$-groups.
%The algorithm implemented here is described in~\cite{OBr94}. 

\endlist

%Further   background   may   be   found   in~\cite{OBr95},   \cite{Vau84}
%and~\cite{NNN98}.

The  {\ANUPQ}  Package  Manual  has  been   written   for   {\GAP}   4.3.
Nevertheless, the {\ANUPQ} Package is compatible  with  {\GAP}  4.2,  but
since it uses the  iostream  technology  introduced  in  {\GAP}  4.2,  it
requires at least {\GAP} 4.2.

Section~"Authors" gives contact details for the authors of the components
of the {\ANUPQ} package.  A  brief  description  of  the  background  and
terminology  used  is  given  in  Chapter~"Mathematical  Background   and
Terminology", which  also  cites  a  number  of  references  for  further
reading.

Instructions on how to  install  the  {\ANUPQ}  package  are  located  in
Chapter~"Installing the ANUPQ Package"  and  Section~"Loading  the  ANUPQ
Package" describes how to load the {\ANUPQ} package.

Section~"The ANUPQData Record" describes the global variable  `ANUPQData'
in which various data including the temporary directory in which  various
input and output files are created for and by the `pq' binary and various
results of functions are retained. On an initial reading you can probably
skip this section.

Section~"Setting the Verbosity of ANUPQ via Info and InfoANUPQ" describes
an `Info' class which when set to appropriate levels allows one to see if
desired all the dialogue that passes between {\GAP} and the `pq' binary.

Most {\ANUPQ}  functions  use  options  (in  the  sense  of  {\GAP})  and
Section~"Hints and Warnings regarding the  use  of  Options"  gives  some
fairly important hints regarding these. Please take the time to read it.

Chapter~"Non-interactive   ANUPQ    functions"    describes    all    the
non-interactive functions of the {\ANUPQ} package; these are ``one-shot''
functions that invoke the `pq' binary in such a way that once {\GAP}  has
got what it needs, the `pq' is allowed to exit. It is expected that  most
of the time users will only need these functions.

Finally,  Chapter~"Interactive  ANUPQ  functions"   describes   all   the
interactive functions of the {\ANUPQ} package; these are  functions  that
extract  information  via  a  dialogue  with  a  running  `pq'   process.
Occasionally, a user needs the ``next step''; the functions  provided  in
this chapter make use of data from previous steps retained  by  the  `pq'
binary, thus allowing the user to interact with the `pq' binary like  one
can when one uses the `pq' binary as a  stand-alone  (see~`guide.dvi'  in
the `standalone-doc' directory).
