\index{ANUPQ}
The {\GAP} 4 share package {\ANUPQ} provides an interface to the ANU PQ C
progam `pq' written by Eamonn O'Brien, making the functionality of the  C
program available to {\GAP}. Henceforth, we shall refer to  the  {\ANUPQ}
interface (resp. the `pq' binary), when discussing the  {\GAP}  component
(resp. the C code component) of the  {\ANUPQ}  share  package.  The  `pq'
program consists of implementations of the following algorithms:

\beginlist

\item{1.}
A *$p$-quotient algorithm* to compute power-commutator presentations  for
$p$-factor groups of finitely presented groups.

%The algorithm implemented here is based on that described by  Newman  and
%O'Brien \cite{NO96}, Havas and Newman~\cite{HN80}, and papers referred to
%there. Another description of  the  algorithm  is  given  by  Vaughan-Lee
%(see~\cite{Vau90a}, \cite{Vau90b}).  A  FORTRAN  implementation  of  this
%algorithm was programmed by Alford and Havas. The basic  data  structures
%of that implementation are retained.

\item{2.} 
A  *$p$-group  generation   algorithm*   to   generate   power-commutator
presentations of groups of prime power order.

%The algorithm implemented here is based on the  algorithms  described  by
%Newman~\cite{New77} and O'Brien~\cite{OBr90}. A FORTRAN implementation of
%this algorithm was developed earlier by Newman and O'Brien.

\item{3.}
A  *standard  presentation  algorithm*  used  to  compute   a   canonical
power-commutator presentation of a $p$-group.

%The algorithm implemented here is described in~\cite{OBr94}.

\item{4.} 
An algorithm which can be used to compute the *automorphism group*  of  a
$p$-group.

%The algorithm implemented here is described in~\cite{OBr94}. 
%This part of  the  standalone  program  is  not  accessible  through  the
%{\ANUPQ} share package.  Instead,  users  are  advised  to  consider  the
%{\GAP}~4 share package {\AutPGrp}, which implements a better algorithm in
%{\GAP} for the computation of automorphism groups of $p$-groups.

\endlist

%Further   background   may   be   found   in~\cite{OBr95},   \cite{Vau84}
%and~\cite{NNN98}.

A comprehensive description of the background  and  terminology  used  is
given in Chapter~"Basics", which also cites a number  of  references  for
further reading. Section~"Authors" gives contact details for the  authors
of the components of the {\ANUPQ} share package.

Instructions on how to install the {\ANUPQ} share package are located  in
Chapter~"Installing the ANUPQ Share  Package"  and  Section~"Loading  the
ANUPQ Share Package" describes how to load the {\ANUPQ} share package.

Section~"The ANUPQData Record" describes the global variable  `ANUPQData'
in which various data including the temporary directory in which  various
input and output files are created for and by the `pq' binary and various
results of functions are retained.

Section~"Setting the Verbosity of ANUPQ via Info and InfoANUPQ" describes
an `Info' class which when set to appropriate levels allows one to see if
desired all the dialogue that passes between {\GAP} and the `pq' binary.

Chapter~"Non-interactive   ANUPQ    functions"    describes    all    the
non-interactive functions of the {\ANUPQ} share  package,  i.e.~functions
that invoke the `pq' binary in such a way that once {\GAP} has  got  what
it needs, the `pq' is allowed to exit.

Finally,  Chapter~"Interactive  ANUPQ  functions"   describes   all   the
interactive functions of the {\ANUPQ} share package, i.e.~functions  that
extract information via a dialogue with  a  running  `pq'  process,  thus
allowing the user to interact with the `pq' binary like one can when  one
uses  the  `pq'  binary  as  a  stand-alone   (see~`guide.dvi'   in   the
`standalone-doc' directory).
